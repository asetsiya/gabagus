## Notes

Made with the Defold Game Engine.

You must score at least 10 points to unlock online mode, characters and themes.

The main target is the Android platform and the web version may not work great.

"Gabagus" is derived from "gabak" and "gabak" from "kabak". "kabak" means pumpkin in Turkish.

There are too many things wrong in the code. Also many variable and function names are in Turkish. I didn't know these things when I did this project.

At first I started this project just to learn the Defold Game Engine, but it went much further than I expected and became what it is now. It has some bugs, but I don't think I'll spend any more time to solve them. I finished this project more than a year ago. It was just sitting in my files, useless, and I thought maybe people could use it, so I'm releasing it as open source.
